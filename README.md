This repository contains documentation for several AWS tasks I have completed to deepen my understanding of cloud computing concepts through hands-on experience. It includes detailed walkthroughs of configuring IAM policies and roles, setting up VPC peering between isolated networks, implementing path-based routing using an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and configuring Auto Scaling Groups to manage instance availability and load. I have also worked on hosting a domain using Amazon Route 53, managing S3 buckets and objects via the AWS CLI, and exploring EC2, EBS Snapshots, and AMIs to understand storage-level and system-level backup strategies. Each task has been documented thoroughly to serve as both a learning resource and a reference for future projects :D
